# Level 2

A worker is either a `medic` or an `intern` and their shifts are paid according their status.

Per shift, a medic is paid 270 € and an intern is paid 126 €.

Adapt the price computation to take these new rules into account.


# Answer Level 2

In this level, the difficulty is on calculation of price, by status.

I've decided to extract this difficulty in a new method : "price_by_status"
